# When running on X, the `SDL_Init()` call eventually calls through
# to some X code, namely:
#
#     char *XSetLocaleModifiers(char *modifier_list);
#
# Which returns an allocated string that applications are not allowed
# to free:
#
#     $ sudo apt install libx11-doc
#     $ man XSetLocaleModifiers
#
# > The returned modifiers string is owned by Xlib and should  not
# > be  modified  or freed by the client.  It may be freed by Xlib
# > after the current locale  or  modifiers  are  changed.   Until
# > freed, it will not be modified by Xlib.
